Ques . A Duck number is a positive number which has zeroes present in it, For example 3210, 8050896, 70709 are all Duck numbers. A number with only leading 0s is not considered as Duck Number. For example, numbers like 035 or 0012 are not considered as Duck Numbers. A number like 01203 is considered as Duck because there is a non-leading 0 present in it.
The task is to check whether the given number N is a Duck number or not.

Examples:
Input : 707069
Output : It is a Duck number.
Explanation: 707069 contains a non-leading 0 .
Input : 02364
Output : It is not a Duck number.
Explanation: contains only leading 0.
Input : 
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the Test cases. Then T test cases follow. 
Second line contains a string denoting value of N.

Output : 
Print YES if given number is duck number otherwise print NO.

Constraints :
1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ Length of N ≤ 104

Input :
